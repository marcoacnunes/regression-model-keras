## TensorFlow Model Training Logs Visualization

This repository contains scripts and tools to execute and visualize TensorFlow model training logs.

### Overview

We're utilizing TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, to train models on specific datasets. This repository helps in monitoring the progress and performance of these models through generated logs.

4. **Visualizing the Logs**

   Upon running the script, you'll see logs similar to:
   
   ```
   10/10 [==============================] - 0s 776us/step
   ...
   ```

   These logs indicate the progress of the model training for each step or epoch. The value `776us` is the duration it took for that particular step.
